Exercise 

1. The last function is:
	Name - cmd_worktree()
	Return type - Integer
	Parameters - (int ac, const char **av, const char *prefix)

2. The latest version of release notes is RelNotes-1.5.2.txt

3. The cat-file command opens up the tree object as before. The tail -4 command takes the input of the cat-file command and gives the last 4 objects which is passed to the head -1 command, which takes the first file from the last 4 files, hence returns file  "tutorial.txt"

5. The commit message is:
	l10n: de.po: Update German translation for Git v2.31.0

6. The command is given by:
	PAGER='head -n 80' git log --graph --oneline | grep "refactored"
  This command will search for the word "refactored" from the output of the git log command of all commits

  Output:
	| * | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 94bcad7979 sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
| * | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | bbfe5302d5 implement test_might_fail using a refactored test_must_fail
* | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | c18f75a1e9 send-email: add tests for refactored prompting
